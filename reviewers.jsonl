OS dependent handling of calling external processes is handled in subclasses of FS\n- ideally the code for exposing external merge and diff tools should be implemented in a way so that it could also be integrated with jgit command line (this is bundle org.eclipse.jgit.pgm), maybe it's even easier to first implement the basics in jgit and integrate them into jgit command line before integrating them with EGit's UI\n- I would consider to implement this in a more object-oriented way similar to what we did for GitHook and its subclasses, i.e. instantiate the tool classes based on and instance of the respective jgit config class (e.g. pass DiffToolConfig to constructor of DiffTool class) and implement execution of tools in a method of the respective tool class, common code could go in common superclass.

Interestingly the bazel build already has only slf4j as dependency for o.e.j (no log4j), and pgm has a dependency on commons-logging, whereas the maven build uses log4j. I wonder if the bazel build is correct. I thought one needed a bridge between commons-logging and slf4j?\n\nI also wonder what happens in Eclipse. What logging implementation is used there? As long as log4j is included in o.e.j, there is at least that, and it also appears to be active (message on startup about there not being a logger for FS). If log4j is no longer included, what happens at startup, and what logger should be included by whom?", "Patch Set 3:\n\n> * commons-logging is a transitive dependency of Apache httpcore and\n > httpclient\n > * if we don't include a logging implementation in pgm it can't\n > write logs\n > * in Eclipse log4j doesn't really help to emit JGit logs in the\n > Eclipse logs\n > since Eclipse itself has its own way of logging,  I think the right\n > solution would be something like this change started by Gunnar\n > https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96277/ \"SLF4J Binding for the Eclipse\n > Platform Log\"\n > which we could restore and finish.

Too many different frameworks and back-ends. \"You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different\".\n\nFor newer Eclipses, there might also be a bridge from sfl4j to OSGi logging: [1] The problem AFAIK is that slf4j wants only _one_ logging back-end, and it'll complain if there are several.

But you derive from the fact that we want to write <f>/<g> the the file <f> has to be deleted.

The working tree contains the folder âpâ and itâs child âfâ with content 'merge'\n\nHere we delete during a normal checkout content of a user which is not yet saved somewhere. That should be fixed.\n\nGood news: I tested with scripts a lot of structural different situations (nearly 4000) and of course there are a lot of situations where jgit behaves different from native git\nbut at least your change makes things worse only in this case.\nI'll run the tests also for situations where we 'git checkout -f ...', 'git checkout -- <path>', 'git reset ...'", "Patch Set 6:\n\nWhen testing a 'git checkout -f <mergeCommit>' commit operation I see this change only improves the situation.

Dozens of cases where JGit now behaves like native git and whenever JGit behaves different it is at least the same wrong result as before.

But completely ignoring an IProgressMonitor is valid and would respect all aspects of the API contracts.\n\n> Again, as a caller, I would be surprised by this fact.\n\nYes, it's suprising.

I don't see the same behavior on my machine. However, the delay can sometime be a bit longer (especially if no change happened for quite some times), but it rarely exceed 3 to 4 seconds.

But this is not the case (because I force the project deletion and the files are already gone from the file system).

In this case though, I find them to make the expressions hugely less readable. \n\nAs for Optional itself, I see a huge benefit in its use for public API. For purely internal use, it's offset a bit though by the more complex expressions for essentially the same thing - it's still a reminder to check for null, so that's still a good thing.\n\nGiven that, one could of course go back to just using regular ifs and ternary expressions as before, just with Optional. \n\nI'm a bit sceptical if that's still a good use of Optional though, or if we just leave it with the regular null-check that I already added, and get started with Optional by introducing it at the API level in MPC 2.0 - which I intend to kick off in the next weeks."], "is_bot": false}}}

What it means is that, once the sampling gaps have been filled, you wouldn't really need to have NullTimeEvent for the time graph drawing, but they are need for the EventIterator that merges the full and zoomed event lists.

The difference would be that 1. has a default value (Integer.MIN_VALUE) which creates a NullTimeEvent for \"NO value\" then inserts another interval for missing states to fill the gaps.\n\napproach 2. might lose the \"NO value\" information in favor of unknown value. We might event have the cases that merge: i.e. a case 1. : |No Value | unknown values | No value would become |unknown value| in approach 2. are we willing to lose this information?

That is where to save the settings. At the moment you are saving them in the launch configuration, but I believe there has been some chatter in the past about how that is a problem. There is at least one outstanding bug because the other memory view does save in the launch configuration.

However, I reran tests.performance.PerforamnceLargeSuite and the performance gain is actually not so little. The average numbers for UML Nominal in each step are listed below.

Still, also on your machine only the compare time shows a speed-up of roughly 1,20x. In total, also on your machine the entire process takes on average 2,35 seconds less than before the change.\n\nThus, even when the scales are a bit off for the compare time, the basic trend is somewhat similar between your numbers and mine (notable improvement in compare and UML postprocessing).\n\nPlease let me know which changes you are willing to merge and which you'd like to omit. I'll then prepare the new PS.\n\nThanks!"], "is_bot": false}}}

I'd say both compare.ecore and UML.ecore need to be referred to through their NsURI if at all possible.\n\nThe genmodel's change to use MinimalEObjectImpl$Container is not needed (everything is a subclass of Diff which extends MinimalEObjectImpl$Container), but it doesn't hurt. I am surprised though that we somehow re-generated the metamodel but never pushed an up-to-date genmodel (MultiplicityElementChange).\n\nOne action required: check the URIs used to reference other ecores from uml2compare.ecore"], "is_bot": false}}}

It's also possible to cancel scripts. I think it's generally useful to run scripts with an Eclipse Job, especially if we talking about long running scripts.  \n\n > \n > > What about waiting for the first corn keyword and the create an\n > > Eclipse system Job that query for the next script execution time,\n > > sleep until then and upon wakeup run the scripts.

It never gets fed an IProject.\n\nMy point really is that we didn't implement this yet because it's going to be a fair amount of work to get right and we didn't have the time. Thanks for helping us get there!\n\n > So the first check for descriptor is same as in CoreBuildLaunchDescriptorType.getDescriptor(),\n > but where is the second for target?\n\nIt's here: CoreBuildLocalLaunchConfigProvider.supports(). It basically checks if the target is the Local one. For the descriptor, there should be an adapter to IProject so you could use a similar check.\n\nBTW, it would be awesome to have some JUnits for this as well to make sure the enablement is working correctly."], "is_bot": false}}}

Having a color for network/disk and such makes sense.\n\n* Control flow view: Used to understand the states of threads/processes. It _is_ useful to know what it was interrupted by. But here, it means, \"my process was interrupted by another process's network reception\". Visually, in that view, the 'network' is a sub-state of 'interrupted' and could be drawn as the network color with a thick border of the interrupted color (real state/substate visualization)\n\n* Critical path: Used to understand what was blocking a process of interest. Here, the Network/Disk/etc in the view means a link (edge) of that type between 2 elements of the trace, ie \"the destination was waiting for network/disk message [from somewhere]\". The concept of interrupt in that analysis appears like a trivial detail.\n\nThat means the LinuxStyles have different meaning for different analyses and views: they would share the colors, but maybe not the text. Having just 'Network' as text may become confusing when a pink rectangle doesn't mean the same thing in critical path view and control flow view.\n\nI think the best way to experience this would be to port the critical path and execution graph to the linux styles (and os plugin). I can help you with that if you wish, but I recall you already have drafts for that ;-) So let's work on this now.

I can finally say that I am not comfortable that this is good enough. Fundamentally if someone extends GdbLaunch and GdbAdapterFactory and does not install the adapters properly their code is broken.\n\nAt the moment in the example with the GdbExtendedAdapterFactory it happens to all work OK because ISuspendTrigger is registered properly as on the the types GdbExtendedLaunch can adapt to and that type is one of the first ones to be adapter to. If an extender did not register one of the types that was used early on, their GdbExtendedAdapterFactory would never be used and their own session adapters would never be loaded. However the worst case is that the first time that the GdbExtendedAdapterFactory is accessed is not at the beginning of a session and in that case the behviour changes for undetermined reasons.\n\nTherefore, I think that change 69923 should be accepted as it fixes the immediate problem of the current example being wrong.\n\nAdditionally, if extenders want to make sure that their class adapts to new types that come along in the future, then they should use a line like this in their extended GdbAdapterFactory constructor:\n\n    Platform.getAdapterManager().registerAdapters(this, <their extended>GdbLaunch.class);\n\nThat will register programatically the adapter factory against all the types in GdbAdapterFactory.getAdapterList().", "Patch Set 3:\n\nI am updating change 69923 to add in the Platform.getAdapterManager().registerAdapters(this, <their extended>GdbLaunch.class); plus some documentation on the subject."], "is_bot": false}}}

I think something is fundamentally wrong if the property tester needs to know the source provider. (Yes, I see this has changed slightly in the follow-up change, but basically only the access to the RepositorySourceProvider has been hidden in a utility class.)\n2. The text selection originally was included to have correct enablement of GitFlow submenu entries is the context menu in an open editor. To avoid that we re-evaluate the property tester on each text selection change, the RepositorySourceProvider was introduced. Now that we don't handle the text selection anymore, we wouldn't need any of this at all. We could just revert back to commit a612318d (before the RepositorySourceProvider was introduced) and simply remove the text selection handling in SelectionPropertyTestser.getRepository().\n3. Not handling the text selection breaks the context menu in open editors. I don't get any GitFlow entries at all anymore. Yes, I realize that this is fixed in the follow-up change I0bc7aee.\n\nThe RepositorySourceProvider was supposed to do the cheap part (getting the repository from the selection), and enable us to do the expensive part (accessing the repo config) only if the repo really changed, which isn't the case as long as only the text selection within an editor changes. The assumption was that getting the repo from the selection was indeed cheap. We use that same mechanism elsewhere, and it never caused any performance problems. It's used in the lightweight decorator, and also in the ResourceStatePropertyTester and in the EGit UI SelectionPropertyTester (resourcesSingleRepository).\n\nSo, the real question is why is getting the repo from the selection in the RepositorySourceProvider suddenly expensive, when it isn't in other places?\n\nMaybe it's because the RepositorySourceProvider gets instantiated rather early, and the projects are not mapped yet. That's what I read from Andrey's stack trace. If so, there might be ways to mitigate this:\n\n* \"Activating\" the RepositorySourceProvider only once the rest of Eclipse startup is done. Let it return a null entry initially, and switch it on only once the workbench has been restored. At that point presumably the projects are mapped... I don't know off-hand how we'd detect \"workbench has been restored\", though.\n* Alternatively, start a background job as soon as the EGit UI plugin is activated to asynchronusly try to map projects/restore the GitProviders, and hope that by the time the RepositorySourceProvider gets called, the projects are mapped. Perhaps it's even good enough to just try to load the project persistent properties in the background -- I didn't look into what gets ached there when and how.\n* Alternatively, let the RepositorySourceProvider not handle text selections, but let it additionally listen to active part changes, and whenever an editor becomes active, start listening to changes to the editor input, then determine the repo from the editor input. Again, I don't know off-hand how we'd listen to either (active part changes and editor input changes), but I guess Eclipse has the mechanisms we'd need to do that. I'm also not sure if listening to editors is enough -- what about views?\n\nOff-hand, all this job logic here strikes me as rather complicated -- even if in the end, with the follow-up change, it appears to work.", "Patch Set 9:\n\n(1 comment)", "Patch Set 9:\n\n> So, the real question is why is getting the repo from the selection\n > in the RepositorySourceProvider suddenly expensive, when it isn't\n > in other places?\n\nHave updated my Eclipse now also to Mars.1/EGit 4.2.0.201601080847. I do _not_ get any UI monitoring reports, neither on startup nor on selection changes nor on text input.\n\n@Andrey:\n* Do you consistently and reproducibly get these UI \"freeze\" reports?\n* When exactly do you get them?

Happened when I started Eclipse and started doing things before the JDT initialization was done.\n\nJDT initialization always takes an inane amount of time for me, and generally starting to type or invoking context menus or doing just about anything before it's done is a bad idea. Used to be much better in Kepler...\n\nAnyway, in the assorted stack traces I got, I see two things:\n\n1. I see a conflict between JDT setting a persistent property (source attachment) and EGit trying to read a persistent property (team provider ID). If those properties happen to be in the same Bucket, JDT may block EGit.\n\n2. The RepositorySourceProvider may try to access the persistent property concurrently with the GitLightweightDecorator or even ActionHandlers' isEnabled().\n\nNot sure what we could do about (1). But (2) could perhaps be solved by making sure that action handlers don't try to re-determine the repo themselves but use the one determined by the RepositorySourceProvider. (I.e., similar to what the follow-up change to this one does.) That would at least reduce the contention on that persistent property bucket. However, doing so needs probably some more changes. See comment on the follow-up change.", "Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1\n\nI'm getting more and more convinced that this is just masking a problem that sits elsewhere. See bug 486081 and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/64620/ . (I should add that in the UI freeze bug 486081 is about there was no RepositorySourceProvider is sight anywhere in the stack traces.)"], "is_bot": false}}}

Am I permitted to do that?", "Uploaded patch set 2.", "Uploaded patch set 3.", "Patch Set 3:\n\nOur usecase is strange, I admit. The goal is to have an o.e.remote which is visible in launchbar and NOT visible in the core o.e.remote UI (view, pref page, etc). \n\nUnfortunately, an argument could be made that no matter how we do this, it wouldn't make sense.  If the o.e.remote is marked as 'not visible' then it shouldn't be visible in o.e.remote OR in launchbar. \n\nIf it simply has no UI service, then it wouldn't be visible in EITHER of the two. \n\nBut obviously our requirement is that it IS visible in o.e.launchbar, that it has custom icons based on internal details, and that it's NOT visible via o.e.remote standard UI. \n\nIf you're wondering why our requirements are so... strange... its because we didnt even want to use o.e.remote to display our 'target' for launchbar, but the launchbar API *only* allows IRemoteConnection objects in the third box. \n\nOur o.e.remote provides 0 services and essentially does nothing except wrap an org.eclipse.wst.server IServer object. The only reason we're even implementing it at all is to get a custom target into launchbar. \n\nIf o.e.launchbar had a more open interface for what could be a target, OR if it was able to search more places than just org.eclipse.remote.internal.core.RemoteServicesManager for instances of IRemoteConnection (ie if we could somehow create them on-the-fly only for use in launchbar) then we wouldn't need to do any of this.", "Patch Set 3:\n\n> what's the harm of making it visible in the remote UI\n\nIt clutters up the UI, and can confuse users. They will expect to be able to interact with the thing. They don't expect that we simply created it because the launchbar requires an o.e.remote object. \n\nI suppose it's not 'horrible' in the preference page, where the stuff is sorted by types and a specific type can simply be ignored. But in the view, things are all together, and you end up with a list cluttered by unusable objects. \n\nI honestly still believe that the best idea is to open up launchbar to not require o.e.remote objects ;)", "Patch Set 3:\n\n>  Well, servers are remote objects. You'll want to switch to o.e.remote eventually anyway.\n\nYes, we'll want to switch to o.e.remote from RSE, to represent the individual connections \"underpinning\" our server adapter. But we don't want to represent our entire wst.server server-adapter as an o.e.remote.... because then we'd need a \"Server-Adapter\" o.e.remote instance, as well as the various \"ssh Server-Adapter\" and \"telnet Server-Adapter\" o.e.remote connections.  It makes sense for us to represent the ssh or telnet or other connections in o.e.remote. It doesn't really make sense for us to represent the entire server adapter as an o.e.remote.... that's what wst.server is for...  and the only reason we're doing that is to get it visible as a target in launchbar. \n\n> After all the proposed changes, I'm getting concerned about the API getting more complex than it needs to. I've been very focused on keeping it clean. If there are other ways to do this with the existing API, I'd rather do that.\n\nThe problem here is that you'd be going on assumptions.  If you make a decision that a connection that can't be interacted with shouldn't be shown, you'll similarly get a complaint by someone who wants to make a remote for their own uses, have the user not able to change it, but still have it show up in the list They may register non-standard services on it, or add actions to it in the common navigator / view, and so still expect it to be visible. \n\nThe use-cases are real.

But I still feel the separation and cleanup and added comments make the code much more understandable. \n\nAgain, this specific patch isn't because I'm requesting new public API.

Okay, I am not sure whether your solution works.  My concerns:\n\n- Having a \"replace\" field in each filter element is cumbersome, for two reasons:\n\n- (1) Having a \"replace\" field in each search criteria feels strange and non-standard.  I think a better approach would be to duplicate what Eclipse does: Clicking on \"Replace...\" opens a new dialog that allows the search String to be modified and the replace String to be defined.  This would allow to first step to filter the affected elements, and in a second step to decide how the affected elements will be modified.\n\n- (2) The second problem with the current approach is space, as the text fields become too small.\n\n- In the current implementation, replacing a String replaces the complete String, rather than the matched substring.\n\n- The current implementation does not seem to function for XHTML.\n\nSo let me reject this for the time being.  I am not sure whether my suggestions here will lead to the \"best\" solution - we can also discuss the proposed solution on the dev-List.\n\nThanks, Michael"], "is_bot": false}}}

Instead of doing an elaborate caluculation to find the next left and right and then using complicated logic to choose one of them, we could just maintain a list of ComparePositions sorted by offset and side, one for each annotation.

Now, there's nothing saying an interface can't have a cleanup method, e.g. \"close()\" on an IO interface, or \"release()\" on an object\nthat holds some resource, but \"dispose()\" here didn't seem essential as part of this particular interface definition.\n\n(BTW, I have no problem with \"dispose()\" as the name of\nthe method, since I'm where the usage came from!)\n\n> Another thought: In the case of the DSFSessionState\n> implementation of the interface, calling dispose() is\n> probably not necessary, as long as\n> RemoveAllServiceEventListeners() is called. is that\n> perhaps what you meant?\n\nWelll... it's more like if you have a list of the objects\nin question via a \"real\" reference through which dispose()\ncan be called, then dispose() doesn't need to be on the\ninterface. If you're using the interface so that you can have a bunch of objects of various types held only by a reference to the interface, then you might need to expose dispose() as well on the interface to allow them to be disposed generically.

Do you think I should instead create my own IDisposable? \n\n[WRS] Right, you don't want to create a package dependency just to reuse similar functionality. In an ideal world, there'd be a more \"utils\"-ish place where a generic IDisposable interface would live, which everyone could safely reference.
